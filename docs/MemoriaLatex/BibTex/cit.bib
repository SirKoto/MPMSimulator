@article{Stomakhin,
	abstract = {Snow is a challenging natural phenomenon to visually simulate. While the graphics community has previously considered accumu- lation and rendering of snow, animation of snow dynamics has not been fully addressed. Additionally, existing techniques for solids and fluids have difficulty producing convincing snow re- sults. Specifically, wet or dense snow that has both solid- and fluid-like properties is difficult to handle. Consequently, this pa- per presents a novel snow simulation method utilizing a user- controllable elasto-plastic constitutive model integrated with a hy- brid Eulerian/Lagrangian Material Point Method. The method is continuum based and its hybrid nature allows us to use a regular Cartesian grid to automate treatment of self-collision and fracture. It also naturally allows us to derive a grid-based semi-implicit in- tegration scheme that has conditioning independent of the number of Lagrangian particles. We demonstrate the power of our method with a variety of snow phenomena including complex character in- teractions.},

@article{Sulsky1995,
	abstract = {An extension to solid mechanics of the FLIP particle-in-cell method is presented. The particle-in-cell method uses two representations of the continuum, one based on a collection of material points and the other based on a computational grid. The material points are followed throughout the deformation of a solid and provide a Lagrangian description that is not subject to mesh tangling. This feature permits constitutive equations with history-dependent variables to be applied at these material points with no requirement for mapping the history parameters from one point to another. A grid, which can be held fixed or adapted as the need arises, is used to determine spatial gradients. Since the grid is used as an updated Lagrangian frame, the nonlinear convection term associated with Eulerian formulations does not appear. With the use of maps between material points and the grid, the advantages of both Eulerian and Lagrangian schemes are utilized. No-slip impact between bodies, inelastic, elastic, or rigid, is handled automatically by the method without resorting to a special contact algorithm. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

To allow for efficiently scaling up to large volumes of sand, we abstract away the individual grains and think of the sand as a continuum. In particular we show that an existing water simulator can be turned into a sand simulator with only a few small additions to account for inter-grain and boundary friction.We also propose an alternative method for simulating fluids. Our core representation is a cloud of particles, which allows for accurate and flexible surface tracking and advection, but we use an auxiliary grid to efficiently enforce boundary conditions and incompressibility. We further address the issue of reconstructing a surface from particle data to render each frame.},

The level set is defined in the undeformed configuration of the object, and its evolution is designed to represent a transition from undamaged to failed material. No re-meshing is needed since the resulting topological changes are handled naturally by the level set method. We provide a new mechanism for the generation of fragments of material during the progression of the level set in the Griffith's energy minimization. Collisions between different material pieces are resolved with impulses derived from the material point method over a background Eulerian grid. This provides a stable means for colliding with embedded interfaces. Simulation of corotational elasticity is based on an implicit finite element discretization.},

@article{Jiang2016,
	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Simulating the physical behaviors of deformable objects and fluids has been an important topic in computer graphics. While the Lagrangian Finite Element Method (FEM) is widely used for elasto-plastic solids, it usually requires additional computational components in the case of large deformation, mesh distortion, fracture, self-collision and coupling between materials. Often, special solvers and strategies need to be developed for a particular problem. Recently, the hybrid Eulerian/Lagrangian Material Point Method (MPM) was introduced to the graphics community. It uses a continuum description of the governing equations and utilizes user-controllable elasto-plastic constitutive models. The hybrid nature of MPM allows using a regular Cartesian grid to automate treatment of self-collision and fracture. Like other particle methods such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), topology change is easy due to the lack of explicit connectivity between Lagrangian particles. Furthermore, MPM allows a grid-based implicit integration scheme that has conditioning independent of the number of Lagrangian particles. MPM also provides a unified particle simulation framework similar to Position Based Dynamics (PBD) for easy coupling of different materials. The power of MPM has been demonstrated in a number of recent papers for simulating various materials including elastic objects, snow, lava, sand and viscoelastic fluids. It is also highly integrated into the production framework of Walt Disney Animation Studios and has been used in featured animations including Frozen, Big Hero 6 and Zootopia.},
